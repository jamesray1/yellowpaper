How to build
---
In order to build, use the supplied build script (``build.sh``. You can clone the directory with `git clone https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper.git` or use the URL of your forked clone, then `cd yellowpaper` and run `./build.sh`. Then open the produced PDF. If running `./build.sh` again, you can leave the PDF open; you don't need to close and reopen it for it to update). Following the first time, you can use the standard `pdflatex` tools like http://latex.informatik.uni-halle.de/latex-online/latex.php for compiling/preview. It can be viewed in ``PDF`` format after building.
