[Here](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/files/1596574/Paper.pdf#blockhash) is an example of using a link to refer to a specific line of a PDF. Note that the actual PDF is not the latest, it is just used for demonstration purposes. This use is helpful for pedagogical and academic purposes. To get a link you just right click on a link that directs to the target that you want in the PDF (in a browser or program) and copy the link. (To create a link that refers internally within the document, you first create a hypertarget with `\hypertarget{foo}{}` (it's best to put it in the line before what you want a link to direct to, where the first braces is the target name, and the second braces is the text to be displayed, which I have not been able to get to display no matter what I put in). Then you create a link with `\hyperlink{foo}{foo}`, where again the first set of braces is the target name, and the second set of braces is the text that is displayed. Then you get the link by right clicking on the link in the generated PDF and copying the link!
